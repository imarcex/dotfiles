# Dotfiles
Hello! these are my personal dotfiles, here I store them to have them accessible if I need to use them in a new Computer/VPS.

## Tmux
It stores the `tmux.conf` under `$HOME/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`.

## Neovim
It needs [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to work, it is as simple as going to their github and copy-paste a command. It is saved in `$HOME/.config/nvim/`. To install all plugins simply run `:PlugInstall`.

The main reason behind using `vim-plug` and no other modern plugin managers is because of simplicity.
