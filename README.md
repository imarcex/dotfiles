# Dotfiles
Hello! these are my personal dotfiles, here I store them to have them accessible if I need to use them in a new Computer/VPS.

## Tmux
It stores the `tmux.conf` under `$HOME/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`.

## Neovim
It uses [nvim-kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)

## Zsh
Create the `zshenv` file at `/etc/zsh/zshenv`, and store the `zsh` folder at `$HOME/.config/.zsh`

You must understand the files to know where some `PATH` folders are placed, these are my preferences, you may change it if you want.
